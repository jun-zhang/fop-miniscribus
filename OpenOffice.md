# MiniScribus Import OpenOffice file from ver.1.1 or 2.2 > #

## XSLT import trasformation ##

MiniScribus contain a XSLT static lib from xsltproc  Gnome Library.
Inside MiniScribus "cache directory" USER\_HOME/.miniscribe you find a xslt trasformation file .... one MiniScribus init process if this file not exist it write a new one.
You can change this file to import OpenOffice on a different style.


The internal xsltproc lib now at this time work only to import but is real possibel later to transform xml file to xsl-fo.  Or Transform Database table to xsl-fo documents.
